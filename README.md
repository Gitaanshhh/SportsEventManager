# SportsEventManager
 The project is a sports event manager where the user can add, edit or delete team events for 4
teams (can be customised).
The main code is written in Python while the database is maintained on MySQL. It has
various modules like tkinter, PIL, mysql.connector and tkcalender. The project also has a
leaderboard which keeps a track of the score of all the teams.
The program boots into a start screen where the user needs to login to go to the next screen
by choosing a profile and entering the password. Once the user has entered the correct
password and pressed ‘Go’, the main menu appears. The main menu has 2 options, ‘Events’
and ‘Score’.
On choosing ‘Score’, The current scores of all the teams are displayed in a new window.
When ‘Events’ is chosen, another set of options appear – ‘ADD Event’, ‘Show Events’,
‘Update Events’ and ‘Edit Events’ in a new window based on the user’s profile. Teams can
only view the events and scores while the organisers, here the PT staff, can add, edit or delete
events and updates the results of respective events.
The project can create events with names, age categories, date (Optional) and other details
like the number of main players and the number of substitutes in a team for every sport. All
of the above data can be edited or removed.
Results are to be updated in the ‘Update Events’ page, based on which the standings are
instantly updated.
The project aims to reduce difficulties in maintaining a lists of all the events, continuously
updating them and changing them manually in an organised manner, thus making the process
less stressful and data more accessible.
